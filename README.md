# A Leap for Mankind:
# Introducing Programming Concepts through an Interactive Scratch Workshop
***
## Overview / Description
This study addresses the ongoing need for more STEM professionals in the current workforce by encouraging a focused interest in information technology at an earlier age.  This study specifically targets students and others that do not necessarily have a formal programming background. 

This study is inspired by the various simple racing games found on gaming websites. The project originally utilized a hand-tracking motion controller to control the direction, however this was removed in order to facilitate the workshop remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The audience is introduced to procedural programming through an interactive activity where participants develop their own simple racing game using the Scratch programming language. Participants learn basic logical operators and statements, such as ‘if’ statements and ‘while’ loops. 

The use of block code helps simplify coding concepts and makes them more accessible, creating more interest in STEM fields for students.  Through the interactive drag-and-drop architecture of Scratch, students learn how certain algorithms are adopted to create the logic behind a game. 

At the end of the activity, we hope to ignite a strong curiosity for the computer sciences and demonstrate that everybody is capable of learning how to program. We are encouraging the students to become lifelong STEM learners and begin their STEM journey at an earlier age.

## Technologies ##
The two technologies used in this project are the Scratch programming language and Leap Motion. Scratch is a drag-and-drop programming language developed by MIT, which aims to introduce children to programming and logical problem-solving in an interactive, easily digestible manner. Scratch also provides an online community where users can share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world.  Scratch is designed and maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab (Scratch, n.d.).

Leap Motion is a computer hardware sensor device that supports hand and finger motions as inputs. We use this technology to add functionality to the code and be able to move a car along a track by just moving your hand left and right without touching anything.  We decided to remove the Leap Motion from our interactive activity in order to facilitate the workshop remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Outreach Activities ##
**1. Tap Expo - April 28, 2020** Demonstration the working game to Georgia Gwinnett students and faculty via Zoom. To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students.
**2. Online Virtual Workshop - April 21, 2020**  Middle school students to promote IT and STEM careers. 
**3. Online Virtual Classroom Workshops - April 7 and April 14, 2020**  Intro to computing and Digital media students to promote IT and STEM careers to non-IT college students. 
**4. Individual Workshops**
* To ignite curiosity and interest in the Technology field by introducing programming concepts to general audiences interactively.

## User Access ##
Users must use the ScratchX to access the application, because Leap Motion controller is considered an experimental extension as of Scratch 3.0:
http://scratchx.org/?url=http://khanning.github.io/scratch-leapmotion-extension/leapmotion_extension.js#scratch
***
## Installation (with LeapMotion Controller Functionality) ##
1. Downlaod project from Github Repository
     * Note: Workshop files are in the 'workshop_code' folder
2. Install Leap Motion drivers on host PC
3. Install Scratch Extension Browser Plugin
4. Navigate to ScratchX website and load project
5. Ensure Leap Motion extension is recognized in browser (small green circle in ScratchX interface)
6. Load desired project file into ScratchX: 
    * LeapForMankind_Racing_Game_with_LeapMotion.sbx - full game (with Leap Motion controller support)
    * LeapForMankind_Racing_Game.sbx - full game (without Leap Motion controller support)
    * starter_code.sb2 - Used for online workshop
7. Click the green flag to start the game
